Among the truths you will do well to contemplate most frequently are these two: first, that things can never touch the soul, but stand enert outside it, so that disquiet can arise only from fancies within; and secondly, that all visible objects change in a moment, and will be no more. Think of the countless changes in which you yourself have had a part. The whole universe is change, and life itself is but what you deem it. - Marcus Aurelius

There were times when I thought I couldn't learn a new language, apply a new skill, teach, or do something outside my comfort zone. But I trusted the journey and I'm still thriving.
