As cliche as this sounds, I'm writing my new years resolution here at the end of 2021. 

I've always had a wide range of interests, and still do. But my problem is seeing a project through to completion. My main goal for the new year is to stay consistent with my projects.

1. Hone my creativitiy
<br />
Experiment with some art and designs. I have to remind myself it doesn't have to be perfect. 
2. Keep adding to my skills
<br />
Keep working on projects I'm passionate about.
3. Practice yoga
