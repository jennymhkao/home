As cliche as this sounds, I'm writing my new years resolution here at the end of 2021. 

I've always had a wide range of interests, and still do. But my problem is that I tend to skim the top layers of concepts and ideas. I can't stick to one thing and complete a pet project. So my main goal for the new year is to stay consistent with my projects.

1. Refine my creativitiy
<br />
Experiment with some art and designs. I have to remind myself it doesn't have to be perfect. 
2. Keep adding to my skills
<br />
Muster up the courage to get certified or keep at it with a project on Github.
3. Practice yoga
<br />
I will be kind to myself. I will meditate.
