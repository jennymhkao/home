I might be late into the game just starting up my first blog post using a Static Site Generator (SSG) like Jekyll and hosting it on Github. As I was solving one problem after another, trying to understand the Jekyll architecture, I asked myself why didn't I do this sooner? But I could go into a myriad of things I've done instead and go down that rabbit hole, but let's just say the second best time is now.

It took me nearly 3 full days during my lovely, relaxing winter break with lots of rest, to learn the complexities of Jekyll. I'm now proud to say I know a bit about Jekyll and more about git. This was time well spent.

Hurdles and tips I learned along the way by difficulty:

1. front matter
2. _config.yml
3. gemfile and ruby
4. local file structure 

Now I'm loving the Jekyll SSG because I can focus on content and post random thoughts, things I know, love and have seen with my brain goggles.

namaste.
