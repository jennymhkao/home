Sometime in 2019, I attended a workshop in Hong Kong hosted by Dim Sum Labs, a maker's studio/hackerspace, and turned some LED lights into spectacular earrings. It was neat seeing how it was my first time soldering something.  

To start, we had light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

Couple of lithium cell batteries. One for each side of the earring pair.

We had to figure out which side of the LED was the anode (long-side) of the wire. Then, bending the anode side slightly, I lined up another LED with the same side.

We used soldering iron and wire to solder the end of the legs together. Soldering them together one-by-one and to the earring hook, it slowly turned into a beautiful masterpiece. The wires together are shaped into slots to hold the lithium battery cell.

And Voila! Earrings are charged and ready to party.
