As cliche as this sounds, I'm posting my new years resolution here. I've always had a wide variety of interests, and still do. But my problem is that I tend to learn the gist of things - like skimming the top layer of soy milk (which can be delicious by the way) - I can't stick to one thing and finish a pet project. So my ultimate goal for the new year is to produce content and stay consistent with it.

1. Refine my creativitiy:
Work on some art and fiddle with designs. It doesn't have to be perfect. 
2. Keep adding to my computing knowledge:
Muster up the courage to get certified. 
3. Practice the art of yoga:
This will help me stay grounded and be grateful for everything around me.  

This blog will keep me accountable because in my mind, this blog is out there for all the interpeeps to see, and I want to leave a trace of myself. As if I don't already with social media and Google knowing literally EVERYTHING about me.  

namaste.
