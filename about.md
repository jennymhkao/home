I'm interested in culture, design, education, and technology. 
I was a curriculum designer and educator for young learners while doing some content creation as a side hobby. 
I was in technical support, and now, in computing. 
Learning new things is what keeps me going in life. 
Knowledge is something no one can take away from you.
